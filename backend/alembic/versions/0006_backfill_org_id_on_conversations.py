"""backfill organization_id on conversations and rag_documents

Revision ID: 0006_backfill_conv_org
Revises: 0005_org_tenant_isolation
Create Date: 2026-06-18T10:38:46.315203+00:00

Assigns each conversation (and rag_document) that has a user_id to that user's
Personal Organization. Rows with NULL user_id are left as NULL.

This is a data migration — safe to re-run (NULL rows already handled).
